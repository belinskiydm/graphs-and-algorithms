# graphs-and-algorithms (c++)
Ð¡lass for graphs with algorithms in it (greedy, Dejkstra and str.)
You can:
1. Add graph
2. Add new nodes
3. Change weight of any edge
...Will add new methods if needed

List of algorithms:
1. Greedy way between any two nodes
2. Dejkstra way between any two nodes
...Coming more...

Just for fun.
